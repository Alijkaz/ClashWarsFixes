# ClashWarsFixes

Custom made plugin for ClashWars bedwars plugin

## What does it do?

As ClashWars is not configurable at all, I needed to customize some functionalities of the plugin and add some features that are lacking currently sadly.

So I made this plugin to fix the issues as much as It's possible to externally

## Features
- Boosting generators/forges to drop more resources
- Limiting generators to specific amount of dropped resources as currently ClashWars continuously drop more and more items
- Blocking placing a block on chests and enderchests

## TO-DO
<input type="checkbox" disabled /> I dunno you tell me ðŸ˜„

## Downloading
You can easily download the compiled version of the plugin from <a href="#">here</a>
or compile it on your own as it's opensource
